<p> This Webpage is create to explain how the DOM can be manipulated using java script <p> <br>
<p> The technologies used in this project are <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Html</li>
    <li>Css</li>
    <li>Java Script</li>
  </ul> <br>
  <p>In this the navigation bar is developed dynamically by caluculating the number of section tags present in the webpage.<p>
  <p>We can add any number of sections to our webpage they will be added automatically using the navigation system according to it the 
 css is added dynamically.<p> <br>
<p>The section which is in active state is found through <b>.getBoundingClientRect()</b> and that particular section is highlighted in both navibation bar and the webpage <br>
  <p>I have used several java script functions .appendChild(),.createElement(),.addEventListener() to my java script code to develop the website </p>
